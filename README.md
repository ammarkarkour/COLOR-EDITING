Video editing tool based on colors

#used lanuage : Python 3
#required libraries: Moviepy, cv2, imutils, numpy, math, os, time, tkinter

#Project description : 
This program was inspired by this video https://youtu.be/DQ8orIurGxw . BUt instead of using thumbs up and thumbs down for editing, we use the color green as thumbs up and the color red as thumbs down.

#how to use it:

during taking the video if want the period to be added to the final video use any green object and show it in the video after this period and make sure it is taking more than 30% of the frame. And do the same thing to remove a period but use a red object instead of the green. 
  
  
#This project will be perfect for people who wants a tool to edit the videos during shooting it
